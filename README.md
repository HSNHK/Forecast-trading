# Just for fun

😂😂 صرفا برای خنده 

This project is for the second semester student of Android programming course.
The overall plan of the project is that we teach this pattern to the machine and the machine guesses what will happen in the future.
We give a series of inputs and an output. We can give several inputs and one output.
The purpose of this project is to analyze the stock market and we give the stock market conditions such as sanctions and the volume of past transactions to the machine along with the result.

Now if we give the current information to the machine, it will give us an output according to the previous patterns.
